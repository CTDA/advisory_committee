He opened a PowerPoint presentation for his overview of the CTDA’s accomplishments and challenges throughout the year.

Previous to the meeting the Advisory Board members were sent the Yearly Policies Review suggested changes. No member suggested further changes.

For the Hiring Update, Greg introduced Della Farney, who was present at the meeting. Della is the new Digital Repository Analyst with 100% of her time devoted to work for the CTDA. Her duties include managing the tools and functionality of the repository, connecting content to third party applications, and improving reliability and performance.

For Grants, Projects and Presentations, Greg spoke about connecting the CTDA with the Collective Access project “Connecticut Collections;” the Digital Universal Access Project, with the Connecticut Historical Society and Library; the new Connecticut History Illustrated (CHI) interface; a collaboration with EDSN, the Education for Development and Support Network Foundation, headed by Lynroy Grant; and a grant that CHI submitted to allow older digital projects of institutions around the state to be added to the CTDA.

Greg spoke about updates on Infrastructure with information provided by the Jennifer Eustis, the Digital Repository Content Administrator. Please refer to the Powerpoint for details.

Greg noted new participants who have added their collections to the repository, including the Enfield Historical Society and the Connecticut Museum of Natural History/Office of the State Archaeologist. The terms of several members of the advisory board are expiring but many of them will extend their terms.

Greg showed several charts on use statistics (again, please refer to the Powerpoint to view the charts). More information can be found at http://collections.ctdigitalarchive.org/ctda_all_stats.

Looking ahead there are many initiatives and plans on the table, including individualized login pages in the manage site, third party access to CTDA data, membership with the Digital Public Library of America, shared documentation, and exemplary uses of content and content models. Beth Rose asked about how the repository is prioritizing development. Liz Shapiro asked how we gain new participants.

The meeting concluded at 3:45p.m.
