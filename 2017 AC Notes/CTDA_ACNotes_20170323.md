Notes:  

* Welcome and Introductions  
Thank you to all who have joined us today for our quarterly check-in. We appreciate your ideas and your content contributions. There are a number of improvements that we have planned this year that will help with content management activities. We've seen that people are re-using our content in innovative ways. This is amazing!  

* Grants, Projects, and Presentations  
    - Connecticut Collections: We want to connect Connecticut Collections platform, Collective Access, to CTDA. This is in line with CTDA becoming a data provider. This CC project is moving along with 5 pilot organizations. On April 3rd, there will be a full day program where pilot organizations will talk about their experience. In the afternoon, there will be a hands-on workshop on how to use CC. Currently, CC is working with the CT State Library and their WWI project where 3 new tools will be created: landing page, MODS translator, lightbox feature. The hope for the CC project is to expand this year to an additional 5-10 organizations perhaps with the possibility of a Knight Foundation grant.  
    - Connecticut Historical Society: They are building with the help of Discovery Garden the Digital Universal Access project. They are working on improving their cataloging methods and a collection content management enhancement of Islandora.  
    - Machine Learning and natural language: Seth Kaufmann is looking at a testbed of textual documents to create an index based on natural language.  
    - CHI Interface: [CHI](http://cthistoryillustrated.org) has a new look. They work going forward will be to ensure the main site and the Drupal site have a more seamless interface.  
    - teachIT Portfolios: This organization has been building portfolios and introductiosn to Connecticut based content in the CTDA.  
  
  * Partcipants  
      - EDSN: Educational Development and Support Network Foundation - a charitable organization working with primarily Carribbean and West Indian populations to connect them to education and training.  
      - Manchester Community College  
   
   What about harvested data into PRIMO? The CT colleges and universities would be interested in this. Integration with either ALMA or PRIMO is possible. Jennifer will touch base with Roger Brisson for Ken.  
   
   * Content and Data  
   Data sets are now available via the CTDA's GitHub site. These sets have not been checked for quality and are the raw sets harvested from the system. 
   
   * Worshops and Resources  
   A MODS workshop will be held at Avon Public Library. If you would like a workshop or consultation, contact ctda@uconn.edu at any time.  
   The user conference is back! This will be held in June and CHS has offered to host the event. It would be great to have more presentations and hands-on with object modeling.  
   
   * Update on Infrastructure  
   Hiring update: We are at the end of our hiring process and hope to make an offer in April/May. We now have a tentative timeline for the work to improve performance. This will be shared in the Technical Roadmap and via the CTDA Alert list. Some of this work will require halting content management activities. We will do our best to notify users when this happens.
   
   For CSL: Could you let Bob know when you go to the new storage solution what happens to the audited Dell EqualLogics? CSL needs that audit trail.
