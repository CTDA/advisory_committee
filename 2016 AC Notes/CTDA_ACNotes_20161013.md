####Notes:
* Thanks to everyone for participating in the CTDA. There was a lot of hype generated recently at the Digital Directions conference held in Denver, CO. People wanted to know how we do what we do.  
* Grants, Projects & Presentations:  
** Connecticut Historical Society has received a $300,000 grant to create a management system specific for museum needs. This will be based on the Baseball Hall of Fame's recent work with Discovery Garden. This is a 3 year grant.  
** Maritime CT is a project to bring together UConn Avery Point, Thames Heritage Trail, the town of Groton and other partners to create connections between cultural heritage, museums, and libraries. They are at the beginning stages of seeking funding but have a water taxi.  
** Barnum Museum and Bridgeport History Center received a NEH grant for $190,00 to digitize the personal papers of Barnum. The project will include ways to showcase the project through the use of a project landing page.  
** CTDA held a brown bag for UConn Library staff. This includes updates followed by a discussion. The next one will be in December and is open to anyone.  
** CT Collections now have 5 pilot organizations. There is a learning curve but it is all about the investment put in by the institution. A one day workshop will be held in the spring.

* Bill Memorial Library is our newest participant. Enfield CT Historical Society, Litchfield Historical Society, and Norfolk Historical Society are now testing in our sandbox.
* We recently updated all systems. With these updates, 4 news tools were added: (1) GIS cartographic tool - if "cartographic" is selected as the type of resource in the MODS, then this allows the user to see a tab called Download Original. If the participant adds a datastream for a zip file, then the user can also download this zip file; (2) Ordered newspaper issue batch allows multiple issues and pages to be batch imported; (3) On this day is a display of objects that occured on the current date; (4) Batch derivative is currently only to prepare Dublin Core records for DPLA. Once bugs are fixed, we hope to launch this to all participants.
* Infrastructure updates: We are investigating ways to improve performance. We have several ideas that we're tossing around. Join us for the Technical Roadmap to continue the discussions.
* We had a growth of 2.7% for objects since the last meeting and 2.27% for harvested records since the last meeting. The CTDA is growing by leaps and bounds. CTDA is currently harvested by UConn Library's Primo discovery layer and ResearchIT. Soon, DPLA will harvest as well. For Primo, we are considering using the Ex Libris central index as a way to push out CTDA content to all Primo users.
* We held our 1st in person workshop on Open Refine and MODS that brought around a dozen people. We hope to have another one in the spring.
* We now have video tutorials in addition to our text how to resources.
